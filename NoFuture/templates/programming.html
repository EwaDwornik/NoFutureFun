<section class="programming-text">
  As a final project I built my own website, from a scratch.<br>
  It gave me a lot of joy, satisfaction and frustration, realising how little I knew.
  This prompted me to further my studies, enrolling in a class at HarvardX and Udemy where I learnt more about Front-end.
  I figured out, that it gives me more joy than digging deeper into back-end algorythms, at least for now.

  <br><br>
  I made this website to practice my programming skills. This website is in constant change. In the beginning it was fully based on Python and HTML.
  Now, JavaSCript and jQuerry are taking a decent part of the code, the CSS file gets new colors and I need 3 browsers to monitor its look ;)
